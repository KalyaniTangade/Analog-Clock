# Analog-Clock
This is clock which is created using HTML,CSS and Javascript. This clock will show daily time. Make an hour, minute, and second hand (using HTML and CSS). These hands will rotate as per the system time.
HTML: It is a simple file having the basic structure of the webpage and ID for the clockâ€™s body and for the second, minute, hour hands.
CSS: The CSS is used just for making the clock actually look a bit nicer. We have basically centered our clock in the middle of the webpage.
JavaScript: The JavaScript file will provide the logic behind the rotation of the hands.
